# TCP Broker with RSA and AES encryption and Digital Sign

## Description
School project which required to do a TCP server where the clients connected to the server could choose a topic to join to a specific topic chat where they could speak with other people about the topic they chose.

The project is in spanish but it can be changed to english if you want.

To use the project one must have a java compiler installed in the computer and change the socket parameters so that they can connect to the required server ip.
Also, the project allows for different computers in the same network to connect to the server. For computers from different networks, further testing is required and you are allowed to test it yourself and add any contributions.
